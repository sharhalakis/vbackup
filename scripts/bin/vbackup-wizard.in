"Done! You can now create level 0 backups by running:

and level 5 backups by running:

# vbackup ${STRATEGY}5

Level 5 backups are incremental backups. This means that they only store
differences from the last level 0 backup. This is only possible for filesystem
backups. For all other cases where an incremental backup is not possible (like
database backups) a full backup will be made. To restore a level 5 backup you
also have to have the level 0 backup. This means that you may only delete
older same-level backups.

All configuration options are placed under $myconfdir
If you want to further customize the backup procedure you will have to have
a look at the documentation. All configuration options are documented at
plugin help screens and in the sample configuration files. You can get a list
of available plugins by running:

# vbackup --list

You can get further information about each plugin by running

# vbackup --help <plugin name>

After using vbackup feel free to send feedback to v13@v13.gr
Since this is work-in-progress, this will greatly affect the way vbackup
is developed and what new features will be available in the near future." | more
